Problems:

1. create a base class Vehicle with a method move(). Then, create two subclasses,
    Car and Boat, each overriding the move() method. Write a function that takes
    a Vehicle object and calls its move() method.

2. Create a base class FileHandler with a method read(). Implement subclasses
    TextFileHandler, CSVFileHandler, and JSONFileHandler, each overriding the read()
    method to handle different file types. Write a function that takes a list of
    FileHandler objects and calls their read() methods.

3. Create a base class Calculator with a method calculate(a, b).
    Implement subclasses Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and
    Division, each overriding the calculate() method. Write a function
    that takes a list of Calculator objects and calls their calculate()
    methods with two numbers.

GroupProblem:
Create a base class DataFormatter with a method format(data: dict).
    Implement subclasses JSONFormatter, TextFormatter, and CSVFormatter,
    each overriding the format() method. Write a function that takes
    a list of DataFormatter objects and calls their format() methods
    with some data.
